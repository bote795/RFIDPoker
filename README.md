# The Electronic Texas Holdâ€™em Player


#Project Information 

##Goal
Create a device that contains an AI that will play Texas Hold'em with players via RFID Cards.

##Description
The Arduino was  programmed to interface with an RFID scanner and to include a ranking system for each of the cards, as well as marking an entire set of 52 cards to make them readable to the scanner. A number pad  and a LED screen were connected to the Arduino as well so that messages can be input and displayed. A Project Box was created and 3-D printed. A prototype board was used for the wiring and adapted to easily plug in and out components to arduino.
